\textbf{
    Euler's Formula
} 
\textit{
    Euler's formula, named after Leonhard Euler, is a mathematical formula in complex analysis that establishes the fundamental relationship between the trigonometric functions and the complex exponential function,
}
\begin{align*}
    e^{ix} = cos(x) + i sin(x)
\end{align*}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{solution}\ \\
When $x=\pi$, Euler's formula evaluates to,
\begin{align*}
    e^{i\pi }+1=0
\end{align*}
Which is Euler's identify.
\end{solution}
